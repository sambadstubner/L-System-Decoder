# L-System Decoder

This script attempts to find all rulesets of a deterministic L-System given at least two generations of output string.


## Usage

```bash
python decode.py [filepath]
```

The input file should be a text file representing at least two generations of the system separated by a new line. You can see many examples at l_systems/output
